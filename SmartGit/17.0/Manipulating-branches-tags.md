# Manipulating branches/tags

## Adding, Renaming and Deleting Branches and Tags

You can add, rename and delete branches and tags both from the main
window and from the [Log](Log.md#Log-log) window.

### Main Window

The **Branches** view on the main window has various context menu
entries for adding, renaming and deleting selected branches and tags.
These commands can also be invoked via the entries in the **Branch**
menu.

Use **Branch \| Add Tag** or **Branch \| Add Branch** to create a tag or
branch at the current HEAD.



To sign an (annotated) tag, you need to have the GPG program and key
configured in the  [repository settings](Repository-Settings.md).



### Log Window

On the Log window, you can add a branch or tag on a commit by selecting
the commit in the Log graph and invoking **Add Branch** or **Add Tag**
in the commit's context menu. Similarly, you can delete a branch or tag
by selecting the commit to which the branch or tag pointer is attached
and invoking **Delete** in the commit's context menu.

Via the context menu of the Log window's **Branches** view, you can add
and delete branches and tags as well. In addition to that, the
**Branches** view also allows you to rename branches.
