# Switching the SmartGit GUI to a certain locale

You can switch SmartGit to supported non-English locales in the
**Preferences**, **User Interface**, **Language**.

# Contributing translations

SmartGit translations are managed in the public repository
<https://github.com/syntevo/smartgit-translations>. Contributing to
translations happens in two ways:

-   translating not yet translated texts from a language mapping file,
    like
    [zh-CN/mapping_dev.zh_CN](https://github.com/syntevo/smartgit-translations/blob/master/zh-CN/mapping_dev.zh_CN)
-   i18n development mode (translation changes are reread automatically)

## Translating existing texts from language mapping files

This requires only minimal effort on your side, however you will not
immediately benefit from your translations but you have to wait until
they have been incorporated into the next SmartGit build.

-   fork the
    [smartgit-translations](https://github.com/syntevo/smartgit-translations)
    repository in GitHub
-   apply your translations to
    [zh-CN/mapping_dev.zh_CN](https://github.com/syntevo/smartgit-translations/blob/master/zh-CN/mapping_dev.zh_CN)
-   send us a pull request to incorporate your translations

## I18n development mode

This requires an initial setup effort but rewards you by seeing your
translations immediately.

1.  Fork the
    [smartgit-translations](https://github.com/syntevo/smartgit-translations)
    repository in GitHub and get a local clone of your fork to your
    disk. For subsequent explanations, we assume the clone to be located
    in `ED:\smartgit-translations`.

2.  To put SmartGit into i18n development mode, add following properties
    to [smartgit.properties](System-Properties.md):



    ``` java
    smartgit.i18n=<locale>
    smartgit.debug.i18n.development=<development-directory>
    smartgit.debug.i18n.master=<repo-root>/mapping
    ```



    Replace `<locale>` by the locale you want to work with and set
    `<development-directory>` to the appropriate locale's sub-directory
    of the translation repository. For example:



    **Example**



    ``` java
    smartgit.i18n=zh-CN
    smartgit.debug.i18n.development=D:/smartgit-translations/zh-CN
    smartgit.debug.i18n.master=D:/smartgit-translations/mapping
    ```



3.  Exit and restart SmartGit

### Layout of the development area

In i18n development mode following files will be created in the
development directory:

-   `mapping.<locale>`: the validated and reformatted version of
    `mapping_dev.<locale>`; it will be rewritten on every restart of
    SmartGit, and during the program run, too, if changes
    to `mapping_dev.<locale>` have been detected
-   `unmapped.<locale>`: mappings which are present in the master
    mapping file (`smartgit.debug.i18n.master`) but which are not yet
    present in `mapping.<locale>`
-   `unknown`: texts which have been detected at runtime but which are
    not yet present in the master mapping file
-   `mapping`: an extended version of the 'master' file which also
    contains newly detected `unknown` mappings



`mapping_dev.<locale>` is the only file which you should edit. **All
other files will be rewritten by SmartGit and thus changes will be
lost!**


#### Warning
> The `mapping_dev.<locale>` will be reread by SmartGit when creating GUI
> elements, hence it will usually work well to modify and save this file,
> reopen a dialog or window and already see the results of the
> modification.

### Content of a mapping file

Mapping files are basically key-value files, where the key represents a
certain piece of text in SmartGit and the value represents its
translation. Keys and values (translations) are separated by '='. Keys
may consist of prefixes, hard-coded constants and (dynamic) text which
has been detected during runtime. (Dynamic) text will be enclosed in
quotes.


#### Example


> `dlgSgCommit.btn"Commit"=提交       `
> 
> consists of the prefix `dlg` which denotes a dialog, the hard-coded
> constant `SgCommit` which represents the Commit-Dialog, the prefix `btn`
> which denotes a button (in this dialog), and the detected (dynamic) text
> "Commit". The translation for this key will be `提交`.



There are also special mappings, called "macros" which are starting with
':' and which can be thought of as "pre-processor" directives. Macros
will be used to substitute regular mapping values when writing the
`mapping.<locale>` file.


#### Example


> :\*"Git-Flow"=Git工作流
> 
> will replace every "Git-Flow" text by "`Git工作流`" when writing
> `mapping.<locale>`. Thus, following lines:
> 
> 
> 
> ``` java
> wnd(Log|Project).mnu"Git-Flow"=Git-Flow
> wnd(Log|Project).tbr"Git-Flow"=Git-Flow
> ```
> 
> 
> 
> will turn to:
> 
> 
> 
> ``` java
> wnd(Log|Project).mnu"Git-Flow"=Git工作流
> wnd(Log|Project).tbr"Git-Flow"=Git工作流
> ```





For keys, following meta characters are supported to create patterns
which may match multiple 'simple' keys in SmartGit:

-   `\` - escape character to escape itself or other meta characters
-   `*` - match zero or more characters
-   `$` - variable start
-   `       (,),|` - "or"-group
-   `       %` - variable count
-   `[,],{,} - `reserved, but not yet used

For values (=translations), following meta characters are supported:

-   `$` - variable start

The wildcard match `(*`) is expensier to process and for regular
mappings should only be used for a very small amount of keys, like
"OK"-Buttons. It's fine and even encouraged to use `*` within macros.
Actually, the `*` is even the reason why macros exist: instead of having
many `*`-patterns at runtime which are expensive to process for SmartGit
(for every user running SmartGit), the expensive matching is done at
translation development time (only once per developer)

Variables are of the form `$1`, `$2`, ... and can be used to match a
piece of text in the key and substitute the corresponding variable in
the translation by this text


#### Example
> `dlgSgSvnClientCertificate.wrn"Authentication to the SVN repository '$1' failed with error: $2"= 对SVN版本库'$1'的身份验证失败，错误：$2'`



For certain, unique keys, the matching happens indirectly by using the
master mapping. This allows to skip the dynamic text part from the key.
Still it's necessary to declare the variables used in the mapped
translation and this is where `%` will be used.


#### Example


> `dlgQProxyConnectionFailed.hdl%1=无法连接到 $1.`



"or"-groups are used to summarize identical translations for a set of
keys.


#### Example


> `wnd(Log|Project|Compare|ConflictSolver).mniWindow-fullScreen=全屏`



If a special character needs to be used *literally* in a key or value,
it has to be escaped using `\`.


#### Example
> 
> 
> ``` java
> wnd(Log|Project).tab"Changes of $1 - $2"=$1 的变化 - $2
> wnd(Log|Project).tab"Changes of $1 - $2 \($3\)"=\
>  $1 的变化 - $2 \($3\)
> wnd(Log|Project).tab"Changes of $1 \($2\) - $3"=\
>  $1 的变化\($2\) - $3
> wnd(Log|Project).tab"Changes of $1 \($2\)"=$1 的变化\($2\)
> wnd(Log|Project).tab"Changes"=的变化
> ```
> 
> 
> are the translations of the various forms of the 'Changes' tab title in
> the Log window.



For long mappings, `\` after the `=`-separator can be used to wrap the
mapping.


#### Tip
> If SmartGit suddenly fails to pick up modifications of the mapping file,
> this may be caused by invalid/unparsable lines. In this case try to
> restart SmartGit. If anything is wrong with the mapping file, SmartGit
> won't start up and a corresponding error message is logged
> to `logs/log.txt.0` in the Settings directory.



### Contributing changes to language mapping files

To contribute your changes to a language mapping file:

1.  setup SmartGit as explained above (we assume your repository located
    at `<repo>` and your development directory located at `<dev>`)
2.  apply your changes to `<dev>/mapping_dev.<locale>`
3.  test the changes
4.  wait until SmartGit has rewritten `<dev>/m`apping_dev.\<locale> to
    `<dev>/`mapping.\<locale> (as long as you stick to the formatting
    rules, these files should be identical now)
5.  copy `<dev>`/mapping.\<locale> over to `<dev>/`mapping_dev.\<locale>
    (to continue your work with the reformatted version)
6.  commit and push your changes of `<dev`\>`/m`apping_dev.\<locale> to
    your GitHub fork
7.  send us a pull request

### Contributing changes to the master mapping

While SmartGit is in i18n development mode, it will collect not yet
known text pieces in the `unknown` file. This is what we are doing
ourselves during SmartGit development and which serves as foundation for
extending the master `mapping` file (see above). Contributing changes to
this file is similar to language mapping files:

1.  setup SmartGit as explained above (we assume your repository located
    at `<repo>` and your development directory located at `<dev>`)
2.  use SmartGit to collect new changes in `<dev>/unknown`; these
    changes will at the same time be combined with known changes and
    written to `<dev>/mapping`
3.  copy `<dev>/`mapping over to `<repo>/m`apping (this is the versioned
    file in the translations repository)
4.  review changes to `<repo>/m`apping using Git's diff (e.g. in the
    Changes view in SmartGit)
5.  **tricky part**: in `<repo>/`mapping try to figure out which of the
    changes are static and which are dynamic text and replace the
    dynamic text  
    1.  by **variables ($) in key and value** if the key actually
        contains the dynamic text in quotes

    2.  by **variable count (%) in key and variable ($) in value** if
        the key does not contain the dynamic text (i.e. if there are no
        quotes)


		#### Tip
		> Usually, it's a good idea to trigger the display of the text
		> with dynamic content in a way that the dynamic content changes
		> (e.g. by applying a certain operation to two different branches
		> or commits). This way, SmartGit will log both text pieces (which
		> only differ in the dynamic part) to `unknown` and it will become
		> easy to join these separate lines into one line by substituting
		> with variables.


6.  shutdown SmartGit
7.  get rid of the those lines from `<dev>/unknown` which you have
    processed
8.  restart SmartGit
9.  immediately after starting up, SmartGit should rewrite the
    `<dev>/`mapping file from your updated `<repo>/`mapping and the
    reduced `<dev>/unknown` file
10. continue working with SmartGit and retrigger the operation for which
    you have extended the `mapping` file with even different dynamic
    content; now SmartGit should not add anymore lines to \<dev>/unknown
    (check this)
11. commit and push your changes of `<repo>/m`apping to your GitHub fork
12. send us a pull request

We will review your pull request and apply, or ask for further changes
related to static-vs-dynamic texts.
