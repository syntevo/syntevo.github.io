# Inspecting SmartGit's process using VisualVM

*VisualVM* is a free Java Profiler. This document is written for running VisualVM on Windows. For Linux and macOS, paths have to be adjusted accordingly.

-   Download *JDK 17 (LTS)*, e.g. from [azul.com](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk)
    (unless you already have a JDK 17 installed) and uncompress to e.g. `C:/temp/jdk`.

	#### Warning
	> Be sure to select the correct platform, architecture (x86/x64 for Windows) and bundle: *.zip* for Windows, *.tar.gz* for Linux and *.deb* for macOS.

-   Download VisualVM from [visualvm.github.io](https://visualvm.github.io/download.html)
    and uncompress to e.g. `C:/temp/visualvm`

-   Run VisualVM:
    -  open a terminal
    -  `cd` to `C:/temp/visualvm/bin`
    -  start `visualvm --jdkhome c:\temp\jdk`

-   Once VisualVM has started up, locate the *SmartGit*-related VMs:
    there will be one *main* VM, if SmartGit is running (on Windows
    showing up as `SmartGit`, on Mac/Linux showing up as `QBootLoader`).
    If a SmartGit upgrade is in progress, there will be an additional VM
    (on Windows showing up as `SmartGitUpdater`). If SSH connections are
    currently in progress, there may be more VMs.

#### Note
>
>
>If you can't connect to *SmartGitUpdater* VM, try again running
>VisualVM as administrator, because SmartGitUpdater is usually invoked
>with administrative privileges, too.

#### Taking thread dumps

Thread dumps are useful to investigate hangs or slow performance.

-   Select the VM you want to inspect.
-   Select tab **Threads** and invoke **Thread Dump**.
-   When investigating a problem, it's usually a good idea to create a
    couple of thread dumps.

#### Taking a heap dump

Heap dumps are useful to investigate memory-related problems.

-   Select the VM you want to inspect.

-   Select tab **Monitor** and invoke **Heap Dump**.

-   To investigate the current state yourself, the **Classes** section
    will give you a good overview of the memory usage: sorting by
    **Instances** and **Size** can be helpful to detect (unusually)
    large occurrences of specific classes. By double-clicking a certain
    class, you will switch to the **Instances** view which gives you
    detailed information for every object of this class.

-   To take a full heap dump for debug purposes, select the **Monitor**
    section and hit the **Heap Dump** button there.

#### Note
>
>
>For heap dumps, it's expected to see a lot of `char[]`, `byte[]` and
>`String` objects, as version control is more or less all about bytes and
>texts (paths, file contents, commit messages).

Heap dumps are usually huge, so first thing to do is to store them
locally using **Save As** from the context menu in the **Applications**
view. This way they can be accessed later on and if necessary can be
transferred to us.
