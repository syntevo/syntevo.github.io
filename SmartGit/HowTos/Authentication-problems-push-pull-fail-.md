# Authentication problems (push/pull fail)

This is a collection of common problems and resolutions related to
authentication.

# Preparation/general

`log` denotes directory inside the [Settings Directory](../Latest/Installation-and-Files.md)
containing SmartGit's log files.

While resolving authentication-related problems, it's recommended to
disable **Detect remote changes** option in the **Preferences**,
section **Background Commands** to prevent background operations
spoiling the log file with too many problems.

An *independently opened* terminal/shell refers to a terminal/shell
which has not been opened through SmartGit:

-   On Windows, you will usually just invoke `cmd.exe` from
    the **Start**-button.
-   On Linux or macOS, open a *terminal*

# Error: Authentication failed for '...'

#### Step "Check Command"

Check the **Output** view or the `log`-directory for the exact command
which fails and try to invoke the command from an *independently opened*
terminal/shell.

-   If the command works there, continue with step "Check Git-Shell".
-   Otherwise, check whether the access URL is actually correct and your
    credentials are correct.
    -   If they are definitely correct, continue with step "Check
        Credential Manager".

#### Step "Check Git-Shell"

Open a Git shell from within SmartGit: right-click the offending
repository in the **Branches** view and invoke **Open Git-Shell** and
try to invoke the command from this shell.

-   If the command works there, continue with step "Check Hosting
    Provider".
-   If the command does not work there
    -   if you are on Windows, continue with step "Check Git Credential
        Manager".
    -   continue with step "Check Environment Differences".

#### Step "Check Hosting Provider"

SmartGit's **Hosting Provider** configuration may interfere with the
authentication.

-   If your repository is connected to *GitHub*, *Bitbucket* or another
    hosting provider, known to SmartGit, open the **Preferences**,
    select section **Hosting Provider** and get rid of the corresponding
    hosting provider there. Then retry.
    -   If the command works there, re-setup the hosting provider in the
        **Preferences** again and retry  
        -   if it stops working again, continue with step "Contact
            Support".
    -   If the command does not work without the hosting provider
        configured, continue below.
-   If your repository is connected to GitHub, check whether this
    problem might be related to [organization access](../Latest/GitHub-integration.md#private-repositories-do-not-show-up).
-   If you are not connected to a hosting provider  
    -   if you are on Windows, continue with the next step.
    -   continue with step "Check Firewalls/Antivirus tools".

#### Step "Check Windows AutoRun"

Command Processor AutoRun scripts may interfere with SmartGit's
authentication hook. Open the Windows registry and check whether for key
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor` the
value `AutoRun` is configured.

-   If not configured, continue with the next step
-   Otherwise, temporarily rename the `AutoRun` script to `AutoRun~` and
    see whether authentication works now.
    -   If it works now, consider to permanently disable the AutoRun
        script or [enable Git's credential manager](http://stackoverflow.com/a/15382950).
    -   If it still does not work, leave `AutoRun~` renamed and restart
        with step "[Check Command](#step-check-command)".

#### Step "Check Firewalls/Antivirus tools"

SmartGit is configuring Git with a small utility tool for password
callbacks. Once invoked by Git, this tool is connecting to SmartGit
using sockets to receive credentials. Firewalls/Antivirus tools may
block this socket communication. This can been seen in the [injector log files](#debug-logging-enable-injector-logging) which
will show up a `java.net.ConnectException`.

-   Make sure that SmartGit's executables (on Windows all files in
    the `bin\`-subdirectory) are not blocked from opening a local socket
    or connecting to a local socket
-   If this does not help, continue with the next step.


#### Info
> Sometimes firewalls/antivirus tools will only block SmartGit processes
> sporadically. In this case, you may see unexpected, redundant "Login"
> prompts. For details, see
> [below](#windows-reoccurring-login-prompts-usernamespasswords-seems-to-become-lost-frequently).



#### Step "Check Credential Manager"

If you are on Windows and SmartGit as well as command line Git client
simply fails without asking you for a password,

-   open the Windows "Credential Manager", check for possible Git
    credentials there and get rid of them, then try again to pull/push
    (from command line)
-   If this still does not help, this may be due to a problem in the
    Git-Windows credential handling. You may check by temporarily
    disabling the system credential helper using following command:  
      
    `git config --global --unset credential.helper`and invoke the
    pull/push again.``
    -   if this solves the problem, consider to report this problem to
        the Git mailing list:
        <https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitCommunity>
    -   if this does not solve the problem, continue with step "Contact
        Support".


	#### Info
	> Depending on your system configuration, `credential.helper` may be
	> configured in your repository's `.git/config` instead of the
	> global `.gitconfig`, so you might have to remove it from there.  
	> One of our users has reported that *Microsoft Git Credential
	> Manager* was immediately resetting the configuration to `manager`,
	> so it was necessary to uninstall this tool first.



#### Step "Check Environment Differences"

Compare environment variables of the *independently opened*
terminal/shell and the *Git-Shell* for possible differences

-   If this gives you a clue on what the problem is, please drop us some
    lines at <smartgit@syntevo.com>
-   If you can't figure out the reason, continue with step "Contact
    Support".

#### Step "Contact Support"

Send us a detailed description of the problem, including:

-   the problem resolutions you have already tried,
-   output of environment variables you have compared,
-   the zipped `log` directory

to <smartgit@syntevo.com>

# Error: Could not read from remote repository, GitLab: the project you were looking for could not be found

#### Step "Check GitLab Configuration"

Go to your GitLab server configuration page (or ask your administrator
to do so) and make sure that you have been granted all necessary access
rights. You may start off with granting all possible rights and
step-by-step reduce rights as long as you can still **pull**
and **push** to the offending repository.

-   If you can't get the access problem resolved, continue with step
    "[Contact Support](#step-contact-support)".

# Error (Bitbucket): Server returned HTTP response code: 400 for URL: <https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token>

#### Step "Check Bitbucket Configuration"

On the setup of the Bitbucket hosting provider, SmartGit has retrieved a
"refresh" token which it is using subsequently to request short-lived
"access" tokens. Under certain circumstances, this refresh token may
become invalid. In this case, it will be necessary to recreate the
hosting provider: go to the **Preferences**, section **Hosting
Provider**, get rid of the Bitbucket hosting provider an re-**Add** the
hosting provider.

-   If this still does not resolve your problem, continue with step
    "[Contact Support](#step-contact-support)".

# Error (GitHub): Repository not found

#### Step "Check Command"

Check the **Output** view or the `log`-directory for the exact command
which fails and try to invoke the command from an *independently opened*
terminal/shell.

-   **MacOS**: If the problem is still present there *and* you are not
    even asked for credentials, you may have to [update your credentials in the Keychain](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/updating-credentials-from-the-osx-keychain#updating-your-credentials-via-keychain-access).
    If you want SmartGit to authenticate using OAuth, make sure to
    delete the credentials there.

# SmartGit only stores one pair of credentials for a single domain (e.g. github.com)

#### Step "Check Credentials Helper"

If:

-   SmartGit fails to access a repository on a domain for which you have
    another repository working;
-   and you actually have to use different credentials for both
    repositories

this might be caused by having configured a Git `credential.helper`
(probably in your global `.gitconfig` or in the
system-wide `.gitconfig`). To resolve, you may set `useHttpPath` option,
see <https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials>.

# Windows: Reoccurring "Login" prompts, usernames/passwords seems to become lost frequently

If you are receiving frequent "Login" prompts even your
username/password haven't changed and you always tell SmartGit to store
username/password, this may be caused by antiviral/firewall tools which
are interfering the connection between the *main SmartGit process* and
*credential-helper processes*. To resolve, try to exclude following
executables from inspection by your antiviral/firewall tool. This is
usually done by adding them to some *trusted applications* list:

-   `<smartgit-installation>\bin\smartgit.exe`

-   `<smartgit-installation>\`git\\bin\\git.exe

-   `%SystemRoot%\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`

# Details on the interaction between SmartGit and Git's credential manager on Windows

If you have `credential.helper=manager` configured on Windows, Git will
first invoke special code which tries to retrieve the password from the
Windows Credential Manager.

1.  If the correct credentials are stored there, it's fine.
2.  If not, Windows will ask for credentials:  
    ![](attachments/6979745/10715229.png)
3.  If you will enter the correct credentials there, it's fine.
4.  If you will enter wrong credentials there, the dialog will show up
    again (back to step 2, this happens a couple of times).  
      
    **Up to this point SmartGit was not involved in the credentials
    prompt at all.**  
      
5.  If you cancel the dialog, Git will invoke the `GIT_ASKPASS`
    environment variable callback which is set by SmartGit.
6.  If the correct credentials are stored in SmartGit, they will be
    returned.
7.  Otherwise, SmartGit will show its own credentials dialog:  
    ![](attachments/6979745/10715230.png)
8.  If you will enter the correct credentials there, it's fine.
9.  If you will enter wrong credentials there, the dialog will show up
    again (back to step 7, this happens a couple of times).  
      
    **In either case, the credentials returned by SmartGit will be
    stored in the Windows Credentials Manager, too. Hence, subsequent
    requests for these credentials will be served directly from the
    Credentials Manager (step 1).**

  

# http(s)-Passwort is asked again after restart

A user reported that on his Linux system with older Git 1.8.3.1 he
entered https passwords and told SmartGit to store it, but after a
restart he had to re-enter them. Building Git from sources and using
that (here: latest version 2.27) solved this problem.

# Debug logging: enable injector logging

To intercept Git credential prompts, SmartGit is "injecting" callback
scripts. To enable debug logging for these scripts, perform following
steps:

-   Add following line to `smartgit.properties`, which is located in the
    settings directory:  
    `smartgit.injectorLogging=true`
-   Restart SmartGit
-   Retry the failing operation
-   Once the problem has occurred again, shutdown SmartGit
-   Backup all `smartgit-http-*` and `smartgit-ssh-*` files from the
    settings directory. Also include `logs/log.txt.0`.
-   Upon request from us, compress these files, including the `log`
    directory and send them <smartgit@syntevo.com>
