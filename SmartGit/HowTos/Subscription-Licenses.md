# Subscription Licenses

Subscription licenses are valid only for a certain period. They renew
automatically which requires a payment type that can be renewed
automatically, e.g. credit card or Paypal. After each successful
subscription payment you will get an email with the latest SmartGit
license file. You will need the latest SmartGit license file to register
a new copy of SmartGit - an older, already expired license will not
work.

SmartGit will check for updated subscription licenses periodically and more frequently towards the end of the subscription period, so usually the user will not notice subscription management/update at all.
This will require SmartGit to have access to the internet and, if necessary, a correctly configured proxy configuration in SmartGit's preferences.

Instead of ordering one subscription license for multiple users, you may order single-user licenses for explicitly named users.
That way you easily can cancel subscriptions of users who leave your company.

## Increase the Number of Licenses

If you want to increase the number of subscription licenses, please contact our [sales team](mailto:sales@syntevo.com).

## Decrease the Number of Licenses

If you want to increase the number of subscription licenses, you may
cancel the running subscription and if the licenses expire after one
month, order the new overall subscription license count.
