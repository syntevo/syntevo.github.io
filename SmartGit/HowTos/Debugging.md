# Debugging

## General advices/preparations

Always try to investigate problems with a fresh SmartGit setup:

-   on Windows, use the *Portable* bundle: <https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/download/>
-   on macOS and Linux, temporary use a new [smartgit.settings](../Latest/VM-options.md#location-of-the-settings-directory) directory

#### Why?
> SmartGit has plenty of **Preferences** options and even more **Low-Level
> Properties** which may sometimes affect the behavior of operations in
> non-obvious ways. This is especially true if the behavior you are
> experiencing is unexpected and/or looks like a bug.

### Clean Logs

Before investigating a problem, restart SmartGit with clean logs:

- locate the [Settings Path](../Latest/Installation-and-Files.md) in the **Help\|About** dialog
- shutdown SmartGit
- from sub-directory `logs/` remove all `log.txt*` files
- restart SmartGit

### Reproduce the problem

Once SmartGit has been restarted, immediately proceed with reproducing the problem. Once reproduced, shutdown SmartGit again.

### Send results

When sending logs to us, make sure they are **compressed** either with *ZIP* or *7z*. This prevents the logs from becoming inlined into the email. Include the stripped down settings (see above), if the problem isn't reproducible with clean settings.

### Strip down settings

If the problem is not reproducible with fresh settings, try to copy the settings from your main installation over to the new settings area. This should make the problem reproducible again. Now start to strip down the settings as much as necessary (e.g. to get rid of possibly sensitive information, especially the `passwords` file). Most crashes will be preserved as long as `preferences.yml` is left untouched. Once the settings are stripped down enough, compress them and include them with the logs (see below).

## Enabling debug logging for certain keys

To enable debug logging for a certain key `log4j.foo.bar`, first decide the log-level – whether it should be fine (`DEBUG`) or as fine as possible `TRACE`.
Usually SmartGit support will tell you.
After that add the corresponding line to `smartgit.properties` (in the Settings directory, see [Installation and Files](../Latest/Installation-and-Files.md)).
Depending on the log-level this will be either:

**DEBUG logging**

``` java
log4j.foo.bar=DEBUG
```
Or:

**TRACE logging**

``` java
log4j.foo.bar=TRACE
```
After that, restart SmartGit and repeat the operation for which debug logging should be collected and shutdown SmartGit again.

Now `logs/log.txt.0` should contain `DEBUG` (or `TRACE`) lines for the specified key.
