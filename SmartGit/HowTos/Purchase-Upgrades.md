# Purchase (Perpetual) Upgrades

If the update period of your perpetual license has expired, you can still continue to use SmartGit, but you won't be able to use newer versions of SmartGit.
To renew the support and update period, you need to purchase upgrade licenses.
Basically, upgrade licenses are the same as new perpetual SmartGit licenses, but for a discounted price.

The easiest way is to use **Help\|Register** in SmartGit and click the **Purchase Update** button.
Alternatively, you may open <https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/purchase/#upgrade> in your browser and upload your existing license file.

## Additional Users

If you want to add additional users to your perpetual SmartGit license, you have following options:

-   order the additional licenses independent of the existing ones -
    that way you will have different license files with different
    support and update periods - or
-   also update your existing SmartGit licenses (their support and
    update period will restart) by uploading your license file at
    [syntevo.com/smartgit/purchase-update](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/purchase-update)
    and increasing the seat count to the overall required seat count.
