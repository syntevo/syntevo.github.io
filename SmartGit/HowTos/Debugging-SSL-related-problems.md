# Debugging SSL-related problems

Various built-in SmartGit functionality will connect to *https* URLs, for example:

- **Check for New Version**
- various integrations, like Hosting Providers

When experiencing problems here, it can be helpful to debug Java's networking layer.
To do that, add one or more of the following system properties to the [smartgit.properties](../Latest/System-Properties.md) file, each on a separate line:

* `javax.net.debug=ssl:trustmanager` to debug problems with server certificates
* `javax.net.debug=ssl:handshake` to debug problems with the SSL handshake

After that, restart SmartGit from the command line and pipe the output to a file:

- On Windows: execute `<install-dir>\bin\smartgitc.exe > dump.txt` 2>&1
- On MacOS: execute `<install-dir>/Contents/MacOS/SmartGit > dump.txt` 2>&1
- On Linux: execute `<install-dir>/bin/smartgit.sh > dump.txt` 2>&1

Finally, verify that `dump.txt` contains SSL-related output.

*How to send the dump.txt file*:
Compress the `dump.txt` file as a *zip* or *tar/gzip* archive, and also include the zipped `log` directory from SmartGit's settings directory.
Send this archive, as well as a short description of how to reproduce the problem, to <smartgit@syntevo.com>.
