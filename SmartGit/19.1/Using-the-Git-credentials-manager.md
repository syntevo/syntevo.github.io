# Using the Git credentials manager

By default, SmartGit will handle repository authentication itself:

-   Starting from version 18.1, SmartGit adds a
    custom `credential.helper` configuration when executing remote
    commands to intercept Git's credential callbacks.
-   Up to version 17.1, Git command line prompts for username and
    password will be intercepted and an appropriate authentication
    dialog will be shown.

Sometimes, it may be convenient/helpful to let Git and the operating
system handle authentication instead. You can tell Git to do so by
configuring the Git credential helper in your global `.gitconfig` or in
the `.git/config` of a specific repository. Below are coarse
instructions given for different operating systems, for details refer to
the [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage).

# Windows

Use following configuration:



``` java
[credential]
    helper = manager
```



# OSX

Use following configuration:



``` java
[credential]
    helper = osxkeychain
```
