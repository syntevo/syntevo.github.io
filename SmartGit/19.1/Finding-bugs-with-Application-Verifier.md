# Finding bugs with Application Verifier

# Introduction

Application Verifier is a free tool from Microsoft designed for finding
bugs in software. It's invaluable in searching for "memory corruption"
bugs: without Application Verifier, the corruption is usually detected
far away from the code containing the bug, and crash report is almost
useless. With Application Verifier however, the application is forced to
crash exactly at the location of the bug.

# How to use it

1.  Install Application Verifier
    1.  Download [Windows SDK](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=2033908)
    2.  Install it, selecting Application Verifier. Other components are
        not required.
2.  Configure Application Verifier for SmartGit
    1.  Run "Application Verifier (X64)" from Start menu.
    2.  Use File \| Add application... to add smartgit.exe
        -   Default install path is
            `C:\Program Files\SmartGit\bin\smartgit.exe`
        -   Application Verifier ignores the path and will apply to
            every `smartgit.exe`
        -   If you also use `smartgitc.exe` in your scripts, add it as
            well.
    3.  **IMPORTANT**: On the right pane, make sure that only
        'Basics/Heaps' is selected.  
        Otherwise, SmartGit will not start at all.
    4.  Click "Save". You can close Application Verifier now, it will be
        active until you remove the settings.
    5.  Restart SmartGit once.
3.  Use SmartGit
    1.  If you can remember, at least approximately, what you did when
        you got the crash, try that scenario and see if it crashes.
    2.  Otherwise, just use SmartGit as usual.
    3.  SmartGit will be slower. This is a side effect of Application
        Verifier.
4.  If SmartGit crashes, then you found something
    1.  Restart SmartGit and allow it to send the crash report.
    2.  If you prefer to send the crash report manually:
        -   Go to this folder:  `%APPDATA%\syntevo\SmartGit\18.2` (where
            18.2 is the version of your SmartGit)
        -   Collect recent files with names starting with `hs_err`
5.  If SmartGit doesn't start at all:
    1.  Make sure that you only have 'Basics/Heaps' selected in
        Application Verifier, see step 2c.
    2.  If Application Verifier settings are correct, then disable
        Application Verifier (this will allow SmartGit to start again)
        and report bug.
6.  Disable Application Verifier:
    1.  If you're willing to tolerate the slowness to help us find bugs,
        this is most welcome!  
        In this case, don't disable Application Verifier.
    2.  Run "Application Verifier (X64)" from Start menu.
    3.  Delete smartgit.exe from the list.
    4.  Click Save.
