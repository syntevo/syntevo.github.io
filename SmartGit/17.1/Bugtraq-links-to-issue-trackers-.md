# Bugtraq (links to issue trackers)

If you have set up a so called *Bugtraq Configuration*, SmartGit will
detect issue IDs in commit messages and display links to the issue
tracker in this case. The Bugtraq configuration is stored either in the
`.gitbugtraq` file in your repository root (for all users of the
repository) or in your repositories' `.git/config` (just for you). It
consists of a named `bugtraq` section which basically defines a regular
expression to match issue IDs in your commit message and an URL template
to open when clicking at such an issue link.



#### Example
>
>
>
>An example configuration for the *JIRA* issue tracker at URL
>`https://host/jira` for a project called 'SG' looks like the following.
>
>
>
>``` text
>[bugtraq "jira"]
> url = https://host/jira/browse/SG-%BUGID%
> logRegex = SG-(\\d+)
>                    
>```
>
>
>
>Another example configuration (e.g. for a trouble ticketing system)
>where IDs like '#213' should be matched only at the beginning of a
>commit message. Note that the logregex needs to be put in quotes,
>because '#' serves as a comment character in Git configuration files.
>
>
>
>``` text
>[bugtraq "otrs"]
> url = "https://otrs/index.pl?Action=AgentTicketZoom;TicketID=%BUGID%"
> logregex = "^#[0-9]{1,5}"
>                    
>```

The `logRegex` must contain only one matching group '()' matching the
issue ID. You can use additional non-matching groups '(?:)' for other
parts of your regex (or '(?i)' for case insensitive matching). For more
details refer to the complete specification at
<https://github.com/mstrap/bugtraq>.
