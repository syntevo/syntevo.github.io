# Merge

### 'Normal' Merge

In case of a normal merge, a merge commit with at least two parent
commits (i.e., the last from the current branch and the last from the
merged branch) is created. See the following figure, where `>` indicates
where the HEAD is pointing to:



``` text
                            o [> master]
                            |\
o [> master]                o \
|                  ==>      |  |
|  o [a-branch]             |  o [a-branch]
.  .                        .  .
```



### Fast-forward Merge

If the current branch is completely included in the branch to be merged
with (i.e. the latter is simply a couple of commits ahead), then no
extra merge commits is created. Instead, the branch pointer of the
current branch is moved forward to match the branch pointer of the other
branch, as shown below:



``` text
o [origin/master]             o [> master][origin/master]
|                     ==>     |
o [> master]                  o
.                             .
```



In SmartGit, there are several places from which you can initiate a
merge:

-   **Menu and toolbar** On the project window, select **Branch\|Merge**
    to open the **Merge** dialog, where you can select the branch to be
    merged into the current branch. Depending on your toolbar settings,
    you can also open this dialog via the **Merge** button on the
    toolbar.
-   **Branches view** In the **Branches** view (available both on the
    project window and the Log window), you can right-click on a branch
    and select **Merge** to merge the selected branch into the current
    branch.
-   **Log Graph** On the Log graph of the **Log** window, you can
    perform a merge by right-clicking on the head commit of the branch
    to be merged with and selecting **Merge** from the context-menu.

Regardless of where you invoked the Merge command, you will be given the
choice between **Create Merge-Commit** and **Merge to Working Tree**,
and optionally also **Fast-Forward** if a fast-forward merge is
possible.

If you choose **Create Merge-Commit**, SmartGit will perform the merge
and create a merge commit, assuming there are no merge conflicts. If
there are merge conflicts, or if you choose **Merge to Working Tree**,
SmartGit will perform the merge, but leave the working tree in a
*merging* state, so that you can manually resolve merge conflicts and
review the changes to be made. See [Resolving Conflicts](#resolving-conflicts) for further information on how to
deal with merge conflicts.

### Squash Merge

The squash merge works like a normal merge, except that it discards the
information about where the changes came from. Hence it only allows you
to create normal commits. The squash merge is useful for merging changes
from local (feature) branches where you don't want all of your feature
branch commits to be pushed into the remote repository.



``` text
                            o [> master] (changes from a-branch)
                            |
                        o [> master]                o
                        |                  ==>      |
                        |  o [a-branch]             |  o [a-branch]
                        .  .                        .  .
```



On the **Commit** dialog, you can choose between a normal merge (merge
commit) and a squash merge (simple commit). Thus, to perform a squash
merge you have to choose **Merge to Working Tree** when initiating the
merge, since otherwise you won't see the **Commit** dialog.

### Merge versus Rebase

A Git-specific alternative to merging is *rebasing* (see
[Rebase](#Merge-rebase)), which can be used to keep the history linear.
For example, if a user has made local commits and performs a pull with
merge, a merge commit with two parent commits - the user's last commit
and the last commit from the tracked branch - is created. When using
rebase instead of merge, Git applies the local commits on top of the
commits from the tracked branch, thus avoiding a merge commit.

## Resolving Conflicts

When a [merge](#Merge-merge), a [cherry-pick](#Merge-cherry-pick) or a
[rebase](#Merge-rebase) fails due to conflicting changes, SmartGit stops
the operation and leaves the working tree in a conflicted state, so that
you can either abort the operation, or resolve the conflicts and
continue with the operation. This section explains how you can do that
with SmartGit. Generally, the following options are available:

-   **Resolve dialog** If you select a file containing conflicts and
    then invoke **Local\|Resolve** in the menu of SmartGit's project
    window, the Resolve dialog will come up, where you can set the
    file's contents to either of the two conflicting versions, i.e.
    \`Ours' or \`Theirs'. Optionally, you may also choose not to stage
    the resetting of the file contents, meaning that the conflict marker
    on that file won't be removed.
-   **Conflict Solver** Selecting a file containing conflicts and
    invoking **Query\|Conflict Solver** will open the Conflict Solver, a
    three-way diff between the two conflicting versions (left and right
    editor) and a third version (center editor) that contains the
    conflicting hunks from both sides, along with conflict markers. You
    can directly edit the text in the center editor, and you can move
    changes from the left and right side into the center by clicking on
    the arrow and \`x' buttons between the editors.
-   **Discard command** To abort the merge, cherry-pick or rebase,
    select the repository in the **Repositories** view and invoke
    **Local\|Discard**.

Lastly, if all conflicts have been resolved, you can continue with the
merge, cherry-pick or rebase by selecting the repository in the
**Repositories** view and invoking **Local\|Commit**.
