# Installation and Files

SmartGit stores its settings files per-user. Each major SmartGit version
has its own default settings directory, so you can use multiple major
versions independent of each other. The location of the settings
directory depends on the operating system.

## Default Path of SmartGit's Settings Directory

-   **Windows** `%APPDATA%\syntevo\SmartGit\<major-smartgit-version>`
    (`%APPDATA%` is the path defined in the environment variable
    `APPDATA`)
-   **MacOS** `~/Library/Preferences/SmartGit/<major-smartgit-version>`
    (the Finder might not show the `~/Libraries` directory by default,
    but you can invoke `open ~/Library` from a terminal)
-   **Linux** `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/smartgit/<major-smartgit-version>` (if
    the environment variable `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not defined,
    `~/.config` is used instead)


#### Tip

## Notable Files in the Settings Directory

-   `license` stores your SmartGit *license key*.
-   `logs/*` contains debug log information, for which `logs/log.txt.0`
    contains the most recent logging. It can be configured via
    `logger.properties`. You may remove this file: afterwards, SmartGit
    will return to its default logging settings.
-   `passwords` is an encrypted file and stores the *passwords* used
    throughout SmartGit. You may remove this file: afterwards, all
    passwords are lost.
-   `repository-cache` stores all cached information about repository
    states, e.g. what local branch is checked out, whether there are
    incoming or outgoing changes.
-   `accelerators.yml` stores the *accelerators* (keyboard shortcuts)
    configuration. You may remove this file: afterwards, all
    accelerators will be reset to their defaults.
-   `bugtracker.yml` stores the configuration for the JIRA integration.
    You may remove this file: afterwards, all accelerators will be reset
    to their defaults.
-   `credentials.yml` stores authentication information (not including
    the corresponding passwords). You probably do not want to remove
    this file: afterwards, all credentials (user names, private keys,
    certificates) will be lost.
-   `hosting-providers.yml` stores information about configured hosting
    provider accounts (not including the corresponding passwords). You
    probably do not want to remove this file: afterwards, all connect
    details for all hosting provides will be lost.
-   `notifications.yml` stores information about the state of
    notifications which show up in the status bar in various cases. You
    may remove this file: afterwards, various notifications may show up
    again.
-   `preferences.yml` stores the application-wide settings (preferences)
    of SmartGit. You should not remove this file, unless you want to
    completely reset SmartGit.
-   `repositories.yml` stores information about known repositories and
    submodules, e.g. recently used commit messages
-   `repository-grouping.yml` stores the information about added
    repositories, their names and repository groups.
-   `tools.yml` stores *external* tools which have been configured in
    the Preferences. You probably do not want to remove this file:
    afterwards, all you external tools configurations will be lost. But
    you may like to share this file with other team mates.
-   `ui-config.yml` stores UI related, more stable settings, e.g. the
    toolbar configurations. You may remove this file: afterwards,
    various aspects of the UI will be reset to defaults.
-   `ui-state.yml` stores UI related, volatile settings, e.g. window
    sizes and positions or column widths. You may remove this file:
    afterwards, various aspects of the UI will be reset to defaults.

### Resetting certain parts of the configuration to defaults

To reset certain parts of SmartGit's configuration ("settings") to the
defaults:

1.  locate the appropriate configuration file (`*.yml`)
2.  Exit SmartGit, using **Repository\|Exit**
3.  Get rid of the file(s)
4.  Start SmartGit again

### Synchronizing settings when running multiple SmartGit versions in parallel

A common case where you might be running two SmartGit versions in
parallel is when having the latest release installed ("*older version*",
e.g. 18.2) and you are giving the current preview version a try ("*newer
version*", e.g. 19.1). Once you are first installing/starting the *newer
version* it will copy over settings from the *older version*. From that
point of time, settings will diverge. You may at any time synchronize
the settings of the *newer version* from the *older version* by
following procedure:

1.  start the *older version*, invoke **Help\|About** and from
    **Information** page and write down the **Settings Path** ("*old
    settings directory*")
2.  shutdown the *older version*
3.  start the *newer version,* invoke **Help\|About** and from
    **Information** page and write down the **Settings Path** ("*new
    settings directory*")
4.  shutdown the *newer version*
5.  from command line or file manager, make a backup of all files from
    the *new settings directory*, then delete all files to finally have
    an empty directory
6.  copy over all files from the *old settings directory* to the *new
    settings directory*
7.  restart the *newer version*



It's not possible to synchronize settings from *newer version* to *older
version*.



## Program Updates

SmartGit stores program updates which have been downloaded automatically
through SmartGit itself by default in your home directory/profile. This
allows "light weight", *patch-like* updates which do not require write
access to the actual SmartGit installation directory. As a consequence,
your SmartGit installation directory is usually not up-to-date, but it
will launch the downloaded updates from the `updates` directory. Only
under specific conditions, SmartGit will detect that an upgrade of the
installation directory itself is necessary ("installation update").
Depending on your operating system, the *updates cache* can be found at:

-   **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\syntevo\SmartGit\updates`
-   **MacOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/SmartGit/updates`
-   **Linux**: `${XDG_DATA_HOME}/.local/share/smartgit/updates`


#### Tip
>
>
>You can manually trigger the update of the installation directory from
>the **About** dialog, section **Information**, **...**-button right
>beside **Version**.
>
>If you prefer to keep your SmartGit installation *always* up-to-date,
>you can select **Update SmartGit application in place** in the
>Preferences, section **SmartGit Updates**. Note, that updating with this
>option selected may require administrator privileges.
>
>

### Technical Details

The root directory of the *Updates* directory contains sub-directories
for every major version. Such a *major version* directory contains a
`control` file for the latest downloaded build and a `current`-file
which points to the currently used build. Usually, this will be the
highest build which shows up in this directory. The `control`-file only
*configures* which binaries are part of the build by linking to the
actual binaries which are stored in the `repo`-subdirectory and which
are shared among all builds.

Each new build has a corresponding, digitally-signed control file which
contains information about all required application files with their
download location and the expected file content hash. To reduce
band-width, application files only will be downloaded if they are not
yet locally available. After download, the content will be verified with
the hash from the control file.

When starting SmartGit, the `bootloader.jar` from the installation
directory is launched. This uses the `control` file from the *Updates*
directory to determine which updated SmartGit files to launch that
contain the actual application code.


#### Warning
>
>
>By modifying the `control` file or any other contents within the
>*Updates* directory, you may easily screw up your SmartGit installation.
>Hence, do not touch these files unless you have good reasons to do so.

## JRE Search Order (Windows)

On Windows, the `smartgit.exe` launcher will search for a suitable JRE
in the following order (from top to bottom):

-   Environment variable SMARTGIT_JAVA_HOME
-   Subdirectory `jre` within SmartGit's installation directory
-   Environment variable JAVA_HOME
-   Environment variable JDK_HOME
-   Registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\JavaSoft\\Java Runtime
    Environment

## Installing/running multiple SmartGit versions in parallel

You can install multiple versions of SmartGit in parallel and you can
even run them at the same time. This will be useful if you want to
primarily work with the *Preview* version, but have the *latest
released* version still present as *fall back*. SmartGit has separate
settings areas for different versions, so it's only an issue of
"installation" :

-   On **Linux**, simply unpack every SmartGit bundle you want to use to
    a different directory
-   On **MacOS**, simply unpack every SmartGit DMG you want to use to a
    different directory
-   On **Windows**,
    -   either use **only portables bundles** for every SmartGit version
        you want to work with and unpack them to different directories
    -   use **exactly one installer bundle** for the primary SmartGit
        version you want to work with and **additional portable
        bundles** for the other version(s)
