# My files are displayed with invalid characters, what can I do?

If your files are displayed with invalid characters, you'll need to
change the encoding scheme. To do so, open the Repository Settings
dialog with **Repository\|Settings** and select an appropriate encoding
on the *Text Encoding* tab.
