# Performance Tuning


# Refreshing

There are a couple of possible reasons which may result in slower
refreshing:

-   **Insufficient heap size:** try to increase the [maximum memory limit](https://www.syntevo.com/doc/display/SG170/VM+options).
-   **Network Shares:** make sure, your repository and Git's `HOME`
    directory is located on a local drive.
-   **Symlinks:** try to open the repository from its real location.
    When opening a repository over a symlink (Windows, too!), refreshing
    may be slower.
-   **Background processes (since version 6):** in the **Preferences**,
    section **Background Commands**, try to disable all options related
    to **Refreshing** and **Local and Remote Changes**.
-   **Big Repositories:** if SmartGit is close to the maximum memory
    limit, refreshing may become very slow. Usually, the pre-configured
    memory limit is sufficient, however for large repositories it may be
    too low. Try to increase the limit according to [these instructions](https://www.syntevo.com/doc/display/SG170/VM+options).
-   **.git/index timestamps wrong:** sometimes `.git/index` timestamps
    may be incorrectly set/rounded, resulting in a content comparison
    for all your working tree files. A possible solution may be to
    delete `.git/index` and then invoke `git reset --hard` from the
    command line.


#### Warning

>
>Be sure that you have no *local* nor *staged* changes, before doing so!

>If you encounter wrong .git/index timestamps frequently, please contact

If an invocation of `git status` is *rather* slow, too, you may also
want to try the following:

-   **Switch off ctime change detection:** 
    invoke `git config core.trustctime false` in your repository root to
    ignore the files' ctimes changes when scanning for modified files.
    For details, refer to the [git-config man page](.md).
-   **Inefficient .gitignore:** if you have a large amount of ignored
    files, be sure they will be located in a directory which itself is
    marked as ignored, not just the contained files. Also, be sure that
    there is no tracked (versioned) file contained in this directory. If
    you are encountering this problem, too, please comment and vote for
    [Topic #630](http://smartgit.userecho.com/topics/630).


Example


If many of your ignored files are located directly in the
`out`/-directory, following `.gitignore` line will be *efficient*:

`out/`

while this line will be *inefficient*:

`out/*`

Furthermore, if there is just a single tracked file located in `out/` or
one of its subdirectories, the ignore-processing will be *inefficient*.



## Many Refs

Large amounts of tags (or branches) may slow down Logs, but also the
Working Tree window. You can tell SmartGit to exclude certain tags or
remote branches from loading by using [Java regular expressions](.md)
with following options in `.git/config`:

    [smartgit "refLimit"]
        tagIncludeRegEx = smart.*
        tagExcludeRegEx = .*-I\\d{8}-\\d{4}
        remoteBranchIncludeRegEx = 
        remoteBranchExcludeRegEx = 

If an include regular expression matches the tag/remote branch name, it
will be included, no matter whether the excluding pattern matches.

It is recommended to invoke a `git pack-refs --all` after doing so, to
have the changes take effect in SmartGit.

# Background operations

Depending on your connection to the server, background commands
(especially the remote background commands), may take quite a long time
and it can be helpful to turn them off in the **Preferences**,
section **Background Commands**.

If you see SmartGit taking a long time for **Updating remote state** (in
the status bar) after invoking commands like **Push**, **Pull**
or **Sync**, this may be caused by unusual long execution times
of `git ls-remote refs/for/<branch>`: check the log files to find the
corresponding `ls-remote` invocation logging and see how long it takes.
If it's actually the culprit, you may disable these remote state updates
(per-remote) by adding following line to the appropriate `[remote]`
section:



``` java
[remote ...]
  ...
  smartgitBackgroundFetch = false
```



# Log Window

In addition to the above mentioned problems:

-   If opening the Log window takes a long time, make sure that you
    deselect as many **Branches** as possible, in the ideal case only
    leaving **HEAD** selected. Once reopening the Log window, it should
    be faster.
-   If nothing of the above helps, shutdown SmartGit, get rid of the
    `log` directory inside the Settings directory (see About dialog),
    restart SmartGit, capture the slowness and send us the zipped `log`
    directory to `       smartgit@syntevo.com     `.

# Miscellaneous

-   We have received user reports that SmartGit's user interface may be
    slow if **SuperPuTTY** version 1.0.4.6 (or lower) is **running**.
    Especially, closing SmartGit may take several seconds.
