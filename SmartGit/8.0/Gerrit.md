# Gerrit

SmartGit provides a **Push to Gerrit** command in the **Branches** view
if a Gerrit remote has been detected. SmartGit will detect a remote as
being connected to Gerrit, if:

-   `.git/hooks/commit-msg` exists; and
-   there is only one remote overall or it's the only remote connecting
    to port 29418 (default Gerrit SSH port)
