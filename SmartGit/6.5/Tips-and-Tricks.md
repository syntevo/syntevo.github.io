# Tips and Tricks

## Completion

In input fields for files and directories when typing the file path, you
will get completion hints after a (back) slash. On Unix-like systems you
even can use `~/` to complete content in the home directory.

For the input field to add or edit the path of a Git remote
(**Remote\|Add** and **Remote\|Edit URL**) you can use `../` to complete
relative paths in case you've cloned a repository parallel to another.

To complete file names in the **Commit Message** input field of the
**Commit** dialog, use *\<Ctrl>+\<Space>*-keystroke.

## Text Editors

To select words or larger parts of text, you can press
*\<Ctrl>+\<W>*-keystroke multiple times until you have expanded the
selection as desired. To copy or cut the whole line to the clipboard,
set the caret inside the line without selecting anything and press
*\<Ctrl/Cmd>+\<C>*-keystroke or *\<Ctrl/Cmd>+\<X>*-keystroke.

## Compare

To quickly scroll to next and previous changes, position the mouse
cursor over the area between both sides ("connector") and use the scroll
wheel.

## Speed Search

In tables and tree controls you can quickly find entries by starting to
type their name. With *\<Up>*-keystroke or *\<Down>*-keystroke you can
select the previous or next matching entry, *\<Home>*-keystroke and
*\<End>*-keystroke go to the first or last matching entry.

## Table Columns

For all important tables, you can configure the displayed columns by
right-clicking the table header and selecting the desired columns from
the context menu.
