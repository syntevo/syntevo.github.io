# Interactive Rebase

SmartGit packages the Git interactive rebase functionality (`git rebase -i`) in simple as well as elaborate ways,
both in the [Log Graph](Log.md) and the [Journal View](Journal-View.md):

## Quick rearranging and squashing

Depending on the type of commit(s) selected, you can invoke various
operations from the context menu, most notably, you can easily rewrite
the history:

- To squash adjacent commits, select them and invoke **Squash Commits** and provide the new commit message.
- To reorder commits, just use drag and drop.
- To coalesce two (not necessarily adjacent) commits *with the same commit message*, drag one of the commits onto the other one.
- To change the commit message, select the commit and invoke **Edit Commit Message**.
- To change the author, select the commit and invoke **Edit Author**.

## Modify or Split Commit

To modify or split a commit, select the commit and invoke **Modify or Split Commit** from the context menu.

### Modify

To amend something to a selected (unpushed) commit, use the **Modify** option.
This will start an interactive rebase and stop after the selected commit.
Perform the modification, then **Commit** (optionally using **Amend**).
Finally, click **Continue** (in the banner).
To abort the Modify command and go back to the previous state, click **Abort**.

### Split

To split one selected (unpushed) commit into 2 commits (with the same message), use the **Split** option.
This will start an interactive rebase and stop with the commit's changes in the Index.
**Unstage** or **Discard** all changes that you don't want to have in the first commit, and click **Continue** (in the banner).
After the first commit has been created, you can continue staging changes for the second commit and click **Continue** again, ...
Once all changes have been committed, finally click **Continue** once again to finish the rebase.

## Using the interactive rebase editor

As stated above, you can perform various operations immediately, e.g. reordering commits by drag and drop.
If you have to make multiple changes at once you should rather use the Interactive Rebase.

To start the interactive rebase command, select the first commit that should be changed and invoke **Rebase Interactive From** from the context menu.
In the *Interactive Rebase* dialog you will
be able to squash commits, reorder using drag and drop, edit commit messages,
but these operations will only be executed when clicking the **Rebase** button. In case of
conflicts, the rebase will stop (like a normal rebase, too). After
solving the conflicts, click the **Continue** banner button.
To abort the interactive rebase and go back to the previous state,
use the **Abort** button.

Commits with the same commit message (a prefix "fixup! " is allowed) are
highlighted, so it is easier to see commits belonging together. They can
be amend-squashed by using drag and drop. Alternatively, the Auto-Squash
button offers 2 options how to squash such commits:

-   Neighboring Commits: will squash only those equally named,
    neighboring (adjacent) commits.
-   To 1st Commit: will amend-squash later, equally named, neighboring
    commits to the 1st equally named commit.
