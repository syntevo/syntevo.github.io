# On-premise License Server

To monitor seat usage for a large number of users, it may be convenient to install our *On-premise License Server*.
This will be especially important if the SmartGit installations of your users are not allowed to connect to our central cloud license server.

## Requirements

To run our on-premise server, only Docker is required. This document describes how to set up the *On-premise License Server* in a plain docker environment. If you need to run the server in a more sophisticated environment, like in Kubernetes, please contact our support. Please also note, by default the *On-premise License Server* uses an embedded database that will store data in a volume. Running multiple instances of the *On-premise License Server* in a Kubernetes environment is not supported.

## Server-side installation

1. Contact sales@syntevo.com and provide a short explanation of your environment and SmartGit setup to understand whether an on-premise license server will be appropriate for your company.

1. If appropriate, you will receive a new *on-premise license file*

1. Provide your GitHub username: You need *GitHub credentials* to access the [GitHub packages](https://github.com/users/syntevo/packages/container/package/license-opserver).

1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token to log in with Docker:

   1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens

   1. Click on **Generate Token** and select **Generate new token (classic)**

   1. Configure only the **read:packages** scope

1. From the command line, log in to the GitHub Docker repository:

   ```
   docker login ghcr.io -u <username> -p <pat>
   ```

   For the above command, replace `<username>` with your GitHub username and `<pat>` with the Personal Access Token you have just created.

1. Pull the Docker image:

   ```
   docker pull ghcr.io/syntevo/license-opserver:latest
   ```

1. Prepare host directories for the Docker volumes

   1. On the target server where the Docker image will be run, create a top-level directory `<license-server-root>` which will contain the persistent data of the license server, for example, `/var/syntevo-license-server`.

   1. In this directory, create a sub-directory named `licenses`.

   1. Put the *on-premise license file* you have received from us into this directory. Use a reasonable name that reflects the product, e.g., `smartgit` in the case of a SmartGit license.

1. Start the license server:

   ```
   docker run --restart unless-stopped --name syntevo-license-server -d -v <license-server-root>/data:/data -v <license-server-root>/licenses:/licenses -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/syntevo/license-opserver:latest
   ```

   For the above command, replace `<license-server-root>` with the actual top-level directory, for example:

   ```
   docker run --restart unless-stopped --name syntevo-license-server -d -v /var/syntevo-license-server/data:/data -v /var/syntevo-license-server/licenses:/licenses -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/syntevo/license-opserver:latest
   ```

1. Confirm that the license server has been properly started:

   ```
   docker ps | grep syntevo-license-server
   ```

#### Note
> Syntevo support may ask you to use the `development` builds instead of the stable, `latest` builds. In this case, the package source is `ghcr.io/syntevo/license-opserver:development`.
> A full command line would look like the following:
> ```
> docker run --restart unless-stopped --name syntevo-license-server -d -v /var/syntevo-license-server/data:/data -v /var/syntevo-license-server/licenses:/licenses -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/syntevo/license-opserver:development
>  ```


## SmartGit Setup

### Configuration by system property

We recommend deploying SmartGit with the [system property](System-Properties.md) `smartgit.opLicenseServer.url` pre-configured, so the license server will be contacted automatically on startup. For example:

```
smartgit.opLicenseServer.url=http://localhost:8080/v1
```

### Configuration during Setup

If required, users can configure the license server on-the-fly during setup:

1. In the Setup wizard, on the **License** page, select **Register existing license**.

1. In the lower right area of the wizard, click **Have an on-premise license server**.

1. For the upcoming **License Server URL** text field, enter the URL of the license server, e.g., `http://localhost:8080/v1`.

### Configuration after Setup

If SmartGit has already been started in evaluation mode and you want to switch to the license server, invoke **Help|Register** and follow the instructions from the above section.

## Reporting

The license server provides a reporting endpoint which is meant to be used by administrators only. It is protected by HTTP basic authentication.

1. Find out password: By default, a random password is generated for every startup which is logged to the Docker log file. To find out the password, invoke:

   ```
   docker logs license-opserver | grep "Reporting: "
   ```

1. Invoke the `reportOp` endpoint:

   ```
   curl -u admin:<password> <license-server-url>/v1/reportOp?type=<type>[&from=<from>][&to=<to>]
   ```

   1. `<password>` needs to be replaced by the current password.
   1. `<license-server-url>` needs to be replaced by the root URL of your on-premise license server.
   1. `<type>` specifies the report type. Currently, only `raw` is supported.
   1. `<from>` and `<to>` specify the time range for the `raw` report.

   Example:

   ```
   curl -u admin:ebc89b1511c6eaf29921d7f9219b608e383384df3ac161287d80c39911e10eb4 "https://syntevo.com/license-server/v1/reportOp?type=raw&from=2000-01-01&to=2030-12-31"
   ```

#### Note
> You can specify a custom admin password, by adding the Docker environment variable `-e ADMIN_PASSWORD=<password>`, for example:
> 
> ```
> docker run -e ADMINPASSWORD=mysecretpassword --restart unless-stopped --name syntevo-license-server -d -v /var/syntevo-license-server/data:/data -v /var/syntevo-license-server/licenses:/licenses -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/syntevo/license-opserver:latest
> ```
