# Git-LFS

SmartGit provides the common Git-LFS operations, provided that Git-LFS
has been installed on your system and it's configured in your Git config
files, so it will work from command line.

# Implementing low-level commands

SmartGit implements low-level Git-LFS commands and provides them in the
**Local\|LFS** menu. There is almost a 1-1 correspondence between
SmartGit commands and Git-LFS command line.


#### Example: setting up and adding files to Git-LFS

> We are following the [Git-LFS tutorial](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Tutorial) to add a
> file to Git-LFS:
> 
> -   `git lfs install`: invoke **Local\|LFS\|Install**
> -   `git lfs track <file>`: select an *untracked* file in SmartGit's
>     **Files** view and invoke **Local\|LFS\|Track**; SmartGit suggests a
>     matching pattern for the selected file which you can adjust if
>     necessary
> -   `git add .gitattributes`: right click `.gitattributes` and invoke
>     **Add**
> -   `git add <file>`: right click the file and invoke **Add**
> -   `git commit`: invoke **Commit**

#### Note

> If you are encountering unexpected errors when invoking **Lock** or
> **Unlock** on Window, this may be caused by a strange behavior of
> current Git-LFS versions (2.5) which will fail when invoked with a
> working directory with wrong case. To workaround the problem, make sure
> that the path in `repositories.xml` has correct case, especially the
> drive letter must be uppercase, for example:
> 
> ``` java
> <obj type="@Repository" id="...">
>     <prop key="name" type="String" value="smartgit"/>
>     <prop key="favorite" type="boolean" value="true"/>
>     <prop key="git" type="boolean" value="true"/>
>     <prop key="path" type="String" value="D:\\smartgit"/>
>     <prop key="expanded" type="boolean" value="false"/>
> </obj>
> ```


# Displaying locks

To see Git-LFS lock states in the **Files** views (both Log and Working
tree window), Git-LFS locks verification must be enabled for your
repositories. A corresponding `.git/config` might look like:  
  



``` java
[lfs "https://server/repo.git/info/lfs"]
    ...
    locksVerify = true
```



Furthermore, you have to enable property `status.lfs.locks` in
the **Preferences**, section **Low-level Properties**. This will make
SmartGit invoke additional commands:

-   `git lfs locks --local`
-   `git lfs locks --remote`

after every **Pull**, **Fetch** and after every background **Fetch** (if enabled in the **Preferences**, section **Background Commands**).

The output of these `git lfs locks` commands will be written to:

-   `./git/smartgit/lfs-locks-local`
-   `./git/smartgit/lfs-locks-remote`

Once these files are present, the **Name** column icon will start
denoting the locking state for LFS files.

To make SmartGit also display which files are lockable, set low-level
property `status.evaluateLfsLockableState`. This will evaluate the
Git-LFS `lockable` attribute for every file during the refresh.


Example


The following screenshot shows how this display will look like:

-   `file` is normal file to which no LFS lock information applies
-   `huge` is *locked by someone else*
-   `huge2` is *locked by yourself*
-   `huge3` is *lockable* (configured in` .gitattributes`)

#### Note
> In the **Log** window, lock states will only be displayed for the
> **Working Tree** node.
