# System Properties

Most of the system properties can be edited directly in the **Preferences**, section **Low-Level Properties**.
This will adjust the `smartgit.properties` file which is located in [SmartGit's Settings Directory](Installation-and-Files.md#default-path-of-smartgits-settings-directory).
Only some specific properties may require to edit `smartgit.properties` directly.

Each of the settings in `smartgit.properties` is specified on a separate
line, according to the following syntax:

`key=value`

If a line starts with`#`, the entire line is treated as a comment and ignored by SmartGit.

#### Note
>
>
>The file `smartgit.properties` contains only settings for SmartGit
>itself. If you want to configure your Git repositories, have a look at
>the various Git configuration files instead, such as `.git/config` for
>the configuration of individual Git repositories, and `~\.gitconfig` (in
>your HOME directory) for global configuration options.

## Networking

### java.net.preferIPv4Stack

By default, SmartGit prefers to connect via IPv4. To connect via IPv6
instead, set this option to `false`.

### http.nonProxyHosts

Use these properties to specify servers to connect directly to,
bypassing the configured proxy, for example: `*.foo.com|localhost`.
Note, that only internal code of SmartGit is honoring
`http.nonProxyHosts`. *This does not include Git itself.*

## Company-wide configuration

### smartgit.setupFinishedUrl

This setting specifies the URL to open after SmartGit has been started
for the first time and the setup wizard was completed.

### smartgit.preferences.\<category>.visible

You can use this system property to hide certain **Preferences** pages.
Available categories are:

-   `executables`
-   `externalTools`
-   `compareTools`
-   `conflictSolver`
-   `spellCheck`
-   `proxy`
-   `updateCheck`
-   `bugReports`

To hide a specific page, set the corresponding property to `false`.



#### Example
>
>
>
>To hide the **Tools** page, set:
>
>
>
>``` text
>smartgit.preferences.externalTools.visible=false
>```
>
>
>
>

### smartgit.contactSupportEnabled

Set this option to `false` to hide the menu item **Help\|Contact
Support**.

### smartgit.registerEnabled

Set this option to `false` to hide the menu item **Help\|Register**.

## Update Check

### smartgit.updateCheck.enabled

Set to `false` to disable the automatic checking and disallow the manual
checking for new program versions by hiding the corresponding menu items
**Help\|Check for New Version** and **Help\|Check for Latest Build**.
You should only turn this check off for network installations where
SmartGit users may not be able to perform the update themselves. When
settings this option, you will probably also want to hide the
corresponding page from the **Preferences**, using
[smartgit.preferences.updateCheck.visible](#smartgitpreferencescategoryvisible).

Note that this will also disable notifications of new bugfix releases
which you can upgrade to for free and which improve the stability or
reliability of SmartGit.

If you just want to switch off automatic checking,
use `smartgit.updateCheck.automatic=false` instead.

### smartgit.updateCheck.automatic

Set to `false` to disable the **automatic** check for new versions on a
global level which can be convenient e.g. for network installations. To
disable the check for an individual installation/user, better do that in
the **Preferences**, section **SmartGit Updates**.

### smartgit.updateCheck.alwaysUpgradeToLatestBuild

Set to `true` to make SmartGit check for the availability of a
new *latest build* on start up. *Latest Builds* are the "bleeding edge"
builds between subsequent (minor) *release* builds, like between version
8.0.1 and 8.0.2 or 8.1 preview 3 and 8.1 preview 4. They will contain
the latest improvements and bugfixes. Usually we will ask you to
manually fetch the latest build using **Help\|Check for Latest Builds**.

### smartgit.updateCheck.checkForLatestBuildVisible

Set to `false` to hide **Help\|Check for Latest Build**.

### smartgit.installation.update.workingArea

Use this property to customize the [program updater](Installation-and-Files.md)'s
temporary directory, which is by default located in your home
directory/profile. This should only be necessary if updating is not
possible due to (file system) restrictions in this default directory,
e.g. if execution of files is prevented by the system. On Windows, paths
have to be specified using forward-slashes, like `c:/temp`.

## Bug Reporting

### smartgit.disableBugReporting

Set to `true` to disable sending of [crash footprints](Bug-Reports.md)
(even if configured in the **Preferences**) and skip the option to send
bug reports to us. When setting this option, you will probably also want
to hide the corresponding page from the **Preferences**, see
[smartgit.preferences.bugReports.visible](#smartgitpreferencescategoryvisible).


#### Warning
> When using this option, be sure to provide an alternative way for your
> users to report SmartGit bugs to you, otherwise they will go unnoticed.


### smartgit.license.defaultPath

By default, SmartGit will look for a "default" license file in the
[installation default directory](Company-wide-installation.md). You can use
this system property to specify a different **file system path** for the
default license to look for.



#### Example
>
>
>
>To have SmartGit take the default license
>from `\\license-server\smartgit\license`, set:
>
>`smartgit.license.defaultPath=\\\\license-server\\smartgit\\license`
>
>

### smartgit.license.alwaysCheckForNewerDefaultLicense

By default, SmartGit will only look for a default license, if there is
**no** or **no valid** existing license. Sometimes, it may be desirable
to replace even **valid** licenses by newer default licenses. To do so,
set:



#### Example
>
>
>
>`smartgit.license.alwaysCheckForNewerDefaultLicense=true`
>
>

### smartgit.license.serverPing.url

Enables the license user tracking feature and specifies the URL
(template) which SmartGit will connect to on startup and once per day.
The template is basically a URL for which following keywords will be
replaced:

-   `${email}` will be replaced by the user's email found in
    the `~/.gitconfig` file.
-   `${smartgit.version}` will be replaced by SmartGit's version
    followed by a \# and the build number, e.g. `17.1.1#11176.`
-   `${smartgit.license}` will be replaced by a unique string of the
    registered SmartGit license file.
-   `${smartgit.license.x}` will be replaced by the value of the
    corresponding (case-sensitive!) key from the registered SmartGit
    license file, e.g. `${smartgit.license.SupportUntil}`.
-   `${prop.x}` will be replaced by the Java system property `x`. For
    instance, `${prop.user.name}` will be replaced by the Java system
    property `user.name`.
-   `${env.X}` will be replaced by the environment variable `X`. For
    instance, `${env.USERID}` will be replaced by the environment
    variable `USERID`.

### smartgit.license.serverPing.method

Specifies the HTTP request method to be used, either `GET` or `HTTP`
(defaults to `GET`).



#### Example
>
>
>
>Following configuration will track users on (including a custom `USERID`
>environment variable) at `syntevo.com`.
>
>
>
>``` text
>smartgit.license.serverPing.method=get
>smartgit.license.serverPing.url=http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/server-ping?email=${email}&name=${prop.user.name}&id=${env.USERID}                  
>```
>
>
>
>

## Debug Properties

### log4j.\[category\]

Use this property to enable debug logging for certain SmartGit modules;
`[category]` has to be replaced by the appropriate module identifier.



#### Example
>
>
>
>To enable debug logging for the Refreshing modules, set following
>properties:
>
>
>
>``` text
>log4j.smartgit.refresh=DEBUG
>log4j.sc.vcs.model.refresh=DEBUG
>                    
>```
>
>
>
