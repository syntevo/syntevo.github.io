# Customizing SmartGit's theme colors

You can customize certain colors in SmartGit by patching its themes.
The custom colors are configured in files `light-patch.theme` and `dark-patch.theme` in [SmartGit's Settings Directory](#Company-wideinstallation-settings-dir.default-location).
Depending on the selected theme from the Preferences, the appropriate file will be used.
In case of automatic theme selection (which is the default), your system theme (light or dark) will determine the used file.

#### Note
> These files only will be read on SmartGit start.

## List of customizable colors

The following is an incomplete list of theme colors which can be customized.
This list is subject to change with every major release.
