# Subtrees

Subtrees allow to integrate contents from other repositories into
sub-folders of your main repository. They are an alternative to
[Submodules](Submodules.md).

## Subtrees in the UI

Refs belonging to subtrees will be denoted in the **Branches** view by a
*folder*-symbol. Local subtrees will show up in the **Subtrees**
category. The root commits of a subtree will be denoted by
a *folder*-symbol in the Log **Graph**.

## Basic Subtree operations

To add a new subtree, select the root directory of the repository in the
**Repositories** view and invoke **Remote\|Subtree\|Add**.

To merge (or cherry-pick) a subtree use the **Merge**
(or **Cherry-Pick**) command. SmartGit will understand whether the
source commit is a subtree and in this case perform a subtree merge (or
cherry-pick).

To push commits back to a subtree, select the (remote) subtree branch in
the **Branches** view and invoke **Remote\|Subtree\|Push**. Pushing a
subtree involves splitting changes back from main repository to subtree
repository (more details can be found below).

To reset your main repository to a certain subtree, first **Check Out**
the branch which should be reset. Then, in the **Branches** view, select
the subtree branch to which your main repository should be reset to and
invoke **Subtree\|Reset** from the context menu.


#### Note
> If there are already existing subtrees in your main repository you will
> have to add corresponding remotes for these subtrees using
> **Remote\|Add**.



## Synchronizing changes back to the subtree repository

After having applied changes to files in your main repository which
actually belong to a subtree repository, you can "synchronize" these
changes back to the subtree repository using the **Split** command:

1.  **Check Out** the main repository's branch which should be split
    back.

2.  In the **Branches** view, select the subtree branch to which the
    changes should be split back and invoke **Subtree\|Split** from the
    context menu. The commits created by the *Split*-command will be
    written to the **Subtree-Branch to update**. If you have selected a
    remote subtree branch, you will have to select **Subtree-Branch to
    update** or enter the name of a new branch there; in either case the
    selected branch will then be updated/created


	#### Note
	> SmartGit will not actually split changes back to this
	> particular *branch* but the branch selection serves primarily to
	> identify to which *subtree* the changes should be split back. The
	> underlying Git command will then detect the appropriate subtree
	> commits onto which the new commits will be split back.



3.  To push changes back to your remote subtree repository, tracking
    between the local subtree branch which has just been updated/created
    in step 2 and the remote subtree branch has to be set up. This can
    optionally be done as part of the **Add** wizard or you can do it
    manually:

    1.  In the **Branches** view, select both the local and remote
        subtree branch and invoke **Set Tracked Branch** from the
        context menu.

    2.  The **Branches** will now denote ahead/behind commits for the
        local subtree branch.

    3.  Verify these ahead/behind commits also in the **Graph**.

    4.  Push back the subtree commits by selecting the local subtree
        branch in the **Branches** view and invoking **Push** from the
        context menu.
