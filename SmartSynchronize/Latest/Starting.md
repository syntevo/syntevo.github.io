# Starting SmartSynchronize

## Using the Welcome Dialog

When you click the SmartSynchronize icon, the Welcome dialog occurs.
Here you can select what to do: compare files, perform a 3-way merge or compare directories.
For directory comparison you have the choice between comparing two arbitrary directories or to open a previously saved profile, where a profile is a named directory-pair with its settings (e.g. ignored file and directory patterns).
For more information, see [Welcome dialog](Welcome-dialog.md).


## Using Command-Line Parameters

Alternatively, you can pass the file or directory names as command line parameters.
If you pass three file paths, the 3-Way-Merge opens.
If you pass two file paths, the File Compare opens, if you pass two directory paths, the Directory Compare opens.
If you pass a file and a directory paths together, SmartSynchronize tries to take the opposite file for the File Compare from the specified directory using the name of the specified file.
If SmartSynchronize could not find a suitable command to perform directly, the Welcome dialog is displayed with the specified files or directories in the file or directory input fields.

### Examples

```
smartsynchronize.exe C:\path1\left.txt C:\path2\right.txt C:\path\base.txt
```
This will open the 3-Way Merge with `left.txt` on the left, `right.txt` on the right and `base.txt` as the base, where also the merge result will be stored.

```
smartsynchronize.exe C:\path1\file1.txt C:\path2\file2.txt
```
This will open the File Compare with `file1.txt` on the left and `file2.txt` on the right.

```
smartsynchronize.exe C:\path1\dir1 C:\path2\dir2
```
This will open the Directory Compare with `dir1` being the left and `dir2` the right directory.

```
smartsynchronize.exe C:\path1\file.txt C:\path2\dir2
```
This will try to open the File Compare with `C:\path1\file.txt` on the left and `C:\path2\dir2\file.txt` on the right.

### Command-Line Usage on macOS

To launch SmartSynchronize <emphasize>without</emphasize> passing command line parameters, just invoke the SmartSynchronize application (assuming SmartSynchronize is installed in `/Applications`):

```
$ open /Applications/SmartSynchronize.app
```

To launch SmartSynchronize <emphasize>with</emphasize> passing command line parameters, invoke the following shell-script embedded in the SmartSynchronize application (assuming SmartSynchronize is installed in `/Applications`):

```
$ /Applications/SmartSynchronize.app/Contents/MacOS/Smartsynchronize file1.txt file2.txt
```

To not have to type the full path each time, it is recommended to create a symbolic link to the shell-script in your path (write on one line):

```
$ sudo ln -s /Applications/SmartSynchronize.app/Contents/MacOS/Smartsynchronize /usr/local/bin/compare
```

Then it becomes much less typing:

```
$ compare file1.txt file2.txt
```
